  "body": "Welcome! My name is Trevor Lambas. I have been coding academically for several years now and have dabbled in Java, C++, C#, PHP, HTML, CSS, XML, and JavaScript. I will be graduating from the University of Illinois Springfield in December 2016 with a BS in Computer Science. I have been working with 3 Strand Code(http://www.3strandcode.com/) and have been refining my web development skills in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy the problem-solving aspect of coding. I like having a puzzle in front of me and having to figure out a way to solve it. The best part is that there is rarely one way to do something. Coding is an incredible blend of logic and creativity, much like music. And just like a song you have written reflects your personality, so does code. \r\n\r\nI hope to continue my coding journey and am thankful I have had friends and mentors in the field to help guide me as I find my way, and hope to someday soon be in software development professionally.\r\n\r\nLink to older project files: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0LB9eCVMSVHclhBR2hrUVNmNWc",
